<h2> Top 3 Best movies of all time</h2>

<h3>Burnt</h3>
<p>
 I myself am not sure why i like this movie so much, but one of my favourite actors act in this movie known as Bradley Cooper.   
</p>
<h3>Ready Player One</h3>
<p>
    Its an animated movie, but with real life consequences, but also big rewards if the quest is completed within the game, there are lots of tragedies, heavy loss, and intense moments, but all worth it all in the end.

<h3>Fast & Furious Tokyo Drift</h3>
<p>
    The movie attracts my interests in cars, especially the part of drifting which i love more than anything, the way the car moves, the smoke of the tires tearing through the race way, the sound of the engine, the fluttering of the turbo, the knocking of fenders against each other and most of all the tandem of two cars batteling for first place.
